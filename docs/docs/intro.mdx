__Entity Webservice__ is a Spring Boot application template that lets us set up model driven JSON API web service with
minimal effort. Its goal is to swiftly productionize a persistence webservice with modern CI/CD support.

Entity Webservice is designed for:

- non-business persistence capabilities
- performance-wise caching

It __is not for__:

- security aspect, such as Authentication or Authorization
- any business layer logics

For this reason, Entity Webservice is suitable for a microservice architecture.

Quick Start
-----------

### Getting Source Code

```console
git clone git@github.com:paion-data/entity-ws.git
cd entity-ws
```

### Setting Environment Variables

:::tip

One change the values of `ENTITY_WS_ARANGO_USERNAME` and `ENTITY_WS_ARANGO_PASSWORD` to anything else. The values here
are examples only.

:::

```console
export ENTITY_WS_ARANGO_HOSTS=http://arango-db:8529 && \
export ENTITY_WS_ARANGO_USERNAME=root && \
export ENTITY_WS_ARANGO_PASSWORD=root && \
export ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=$ENTITY_WS_ARANGO_PASSWORD
```

### Spinning Up Services

There is a reference [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) where we could use for production. Simply execute

```console
docker compose up
```

When we see the output like the following

```text
arango-db-1  | 2025-05-11T15:26:29Z [1] INFO [cf3f4] {general} ArangoDB (version 3.11.13 [linux]) is ready for business. Have fun!

```

it means we are ready to play with Entity WS. Let's create a book entity first

```console
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/arango/createDocument/library/books' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "title": "Pride and Prejudice",
  "author": "Jane Austen"
}'
```

Next we will verify the data has been saved into database. The quick start uses [ArangoDB](https://arango.paion-data.dev/)
as the persistence database. We can first hit the Arando web console at __http://localhost:8529/__ which should take us to a
page like the following:

![ArangoDB web console login](img/arango-login.png "Error loading img/arango-login.png").

Use __root__ and __root__ as username and password, respectively. Then navigate to the data page by __Login__ ->
selecting __library__ in database dropdown menu -> click __Select DB: library__ -> click __books__
[collection](https://arango.paion-data.dev/stable/concepts/data-structure/collections/) -> click __Content__ in the top
navigation bar. As we can see the data already exists as an
[Arango document](https://arango.paion-data.dev/stable/concepts/data-structure/documents/) in the database:

![Example Data in ArangoDB](img/example-data.png "Error loading img/example-data.png")

:::tip

One could find more endpoints at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

### Troubleshooting

#### Healthcheck is Failing

[Inspect healthcheck logs](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42738182) with
`docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}" <container name> | jq`

#### ArangoDB Healthcheck is Failing with "ArangoError: not connected"

This is mostly due to the wrong password during the "connection" via `arangosh` used in healthcheck. Wrong password
could be

- [Container is still using the old password from undeleted volume](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/2712#issuecomment-314949756)
