__Entity Webservice__ is a Spring Boot application template that lets us set up REST JSON API webservice with
minimal effort. Its goal is to swiftly productionize a persistence webservice with modern CI/CD support.

Entity Webservice is designed for:

- non-business persistence capabilities
- performance-wise caching

It __is not for__:

- security aspect, such as Authentication or Authorization
- any business layer logics

For this reason, Entity Webservice is suitable for a microservice architecture.
